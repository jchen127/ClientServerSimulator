##Staff Recruiting
Staff can be recruited but qualifications of staff generated can be random. Staff can only be recruited when certain time lapsed as to avoid massive staff recruitment drive.

Staff will be temporarily removed from the pool. he/she will return afterward. The effect of training will be calculated afterward.

##Staff WORKS!
Staffs are essential part of this simulation. Without staffs, your juveniles will die in your detainment facility. Even one staff will be enough to keep your juvenile alive.
So it is better to line up your bad staff and release them later than having no staffs at all.
